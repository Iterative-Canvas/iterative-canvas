# Iterative Canvas

Similar in spirit to ChatGPT, but instead of a long-running and turn-based chat, it offers an iterative workflow in which you are refining a single prompt. Structured evals are used to evaluate the model response. It’s a refinement of the LLM-as-judge pattern. More like... LLM**s**-as-judge. Currently a work-in-progress.
